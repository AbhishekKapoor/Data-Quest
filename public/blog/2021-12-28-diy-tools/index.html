<h2>Some Useful Shinny Apps</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Correspondence analysis</strong> - As I market researcher, we have to deal with brand perception data frequently. And one of the way of analyzing this data is through “correspondence map” (perceptual maps) and mostly researcher are doing this analysis on SPSS which is tedious task as data has to be arranged in particular format. So here is the shinny app where user can upload the data (in csv format where brands are column and in rows imagery statements- Basically it is brand association data for various imagery statements) <a href="https://kapoorabhishek.shinyapps.io/PerceptualMap/">Correspondence analysis App</a></p></li>
